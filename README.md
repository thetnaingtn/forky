## How does synrk work basically?
**synrk** detect the `default` branch(`main`, `master`, or `trunk` whatever it is) of your forked repository and will try to compare it with the upstream repository's `same-named` branch to find how many commits behind by your forked repositories are. Then it will show available forks which left behind the upstream repositories to synchronize.
## Installation
### Mac OS
```sh
brew install thetnaingtn/tap/synrk
```
### npm
Are you a Node.js developer or Node.js is installed on your system? Perfect! **synrk** also available as **npm** package
```sh
npx synrk@latest --token `your github token`
```

## Usage
```sh
synrk --token `your github token`
```
By default, forks that have been updated on the same day the command is run are excluded. To include these forks, use the -f flag.

```sh
synrk --token `your github token` -f
```
