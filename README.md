# Forky
**Forky** is a CLI application that you can use to sync your forks with upstream repositories within your terminal with simple and easy to understand UI. You can select single or multiple repositories at once and update all those repositories with ease.\
The motivation behind **Forky** is to get rid of the burden of syncing one repository at a time. With **Forky**, you can syncing multiple repositories at same time, of course, with a elegance UI thanks to **[Charm's bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)** TUI framework.

## Usage
